# AnimatedGIF Example for ESP_8_BIT_composite color video output library
This project started as the `ESP32_LEDMatrix_I2S` example from
[AnimatedGIF library](https://github.com/bitbank2/AnimatedGIF)
by Larry Bank / bitbank2 and converted to output color composite video signal using my
[ESP_8_BIT_composite library](https://github.com/Roger-random/ESP_8_BIT_composite).

Only 
[mild modifications](https://github.com/Roger-random/AnimatedGIF_ESP32_example/commit/e2d01710b212d384e276cf0a2a179c29ddd4c57d)
were required. As the majority of code were taken directly from the
AnimatedGIF library, this project inherits its Apache 2.0 license.
